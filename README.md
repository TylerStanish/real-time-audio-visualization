The 'dev' branch will probably be where most of the action is going forward

So this is an Electron app with the goal of visualizing the system audio output kind of as you would see in a spctral analyzer (I'm not sure what's its called)

### Danger! I have experienced extremely loud 'flicking' sounds when playing audio and even with the volume off they can still somehow blast the speakers and may blow them out! Since configuring SoundFlower correctly it went away but it might not for anybody else!

##### TODO
If everything goes well, I plan on adding color themes, and even EQ sliders to add bass/mid/treble to your system audio output!
